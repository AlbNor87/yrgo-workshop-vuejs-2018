# 301 The project boilerplate

## Backend and frontend
This project builds on the concept of **Laravel as a backend API** and **Vue Nuxt.js for the frontend application**. 

To give you the most transparency, the two sides (frontend/backend) have been setup from a Tutorial made by [codecourse](https://codecourse.com/) (Alex Garrett @alexjgarrett). Unfortunately the course is not free but a one month subsricption for 70kr would be totally worth it to get a better understanding of how the frontend and backend is connected with the validation.

### [Course: Nuxt js & Laravel Authentication](https://codecourse.com/watch/nuxt-js-laravel-authentication)

[vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli)
>**vue-cli** is a simple CLI for scaffolding Vue.js projects. Use vue-cli as a zero-configuration development tool for your Vue apps and component, check out the [docs](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/blob/dev/docs/README.md).

>Vue CLI aims to be the standard tooling baseline for the Vue ecosystem. It ensures the various build tools work smoothly together with sensible defaults so you can focus on writing your app instead of spending days wrangling with configurations. At the same time, it still offers the flexibility to tweak the config of each tool without the need for ejecting.
